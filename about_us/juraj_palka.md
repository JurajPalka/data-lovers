# About me

I'm Juraj and I am passionate about product optimization and data driven decisions.

I love digging deep in the data as without understanding how, when and with which context they are created we cannot ensure the validity of insights we derive from them.

Understanding complex relationships and figuring out how things work are my strengths.

My extremely high attention to detail and strategic thinking help me track, get, clean and prepare the data properly.

With the help of my SQL and Python magic I find patterns and relationships leading to actionable insights.

I love testing assumptions (A/B testing) when figuring out which solution provides best results.

My deepest domain knowledge lies in optimisation of digital products and understanding users behaviour on the web.

I am a huge fan of constant development: reading non-fiction, studying German, improving on my Python skills and statistical knowledge, interested in new technologies especially in the fields of energy and healthcare. I would also love to pick up on JS basics for the purposes of data visualisation.

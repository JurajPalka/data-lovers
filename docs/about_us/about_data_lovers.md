We are a group of data enthusiasts who love to share knowledge and help each other by sharing best practice and helping to review each others code.

We have a slack community to discuss problems and challenges from our work and ask each other for help or advice. 

Feel free to ask to join our community at jurajpalka1@gmail.com

Why data lovers? 

If you are used to working in a single company in a team and have colleagues who can give you advice and help when you need it, you are lucky and be thankful for it. Once you start working on your own either on your own project or as a single data person in a startup, you will soon realize how difficult it is to have no one to give you a second opinion on anything. That is why we decided to have a community with like-minded individuals and learn from each other.

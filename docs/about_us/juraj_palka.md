# About me

I'm Juraj and I am passionate about data, analytics and energy ("Decentralise, decarbonise, digitalise")

I love digging deep in the data as without understanding how, when and with which context they are created we cannot ensure the validity of insights we derive from them.

Understanding complex relationships and figuring out how things work are my strengths.

My extremely high attention to detail and strategic thinking help me get, clean and prepare the data properly.

With the help of Python I find patterns and relationships leading to actionable insights.

I have a developer's approach to working with data and analytics. I love automated and scalable solutions with a neat infrastructure behind it.

I bring data insights into production, I automate workflows using Airflow and deliver prediction models as APIs.

I love testing assumptions (A/B testing) when figuring out which solution provides best results.

I am a huge fan of constant development: reading non-fiction, improving on my Python skills and statistical knowledge, interested in new technologies in when working with data and in the energy sector.

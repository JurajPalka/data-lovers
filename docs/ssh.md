# Generate a new SSH on Windows
1. Open Git Bash in the `.ssh` folder
2. Paste the following code adjusting your email address ```ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"```
This creates a new SSH key using the provided email as label.
3. You are prompted to enter a file in which to save the key. If you are going to use only a single ssh key accept the default location. In case you wish to use multiple SSH keys, you should generate a `.config` file to manage your ssh keys.
4. You are prompted to enter a [secure passphrase](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases). You can keep it empty if you don't fear someone getting access to your computer.
5. Once your ssh key is generated, use the following code to copy it: ```cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```
6. Now paste the code to the application for which you are creating ssh (e.g. GitLab or GitHub)
7. In case you don't want to create a new SSH every time you change a device or re-install your OS, save your SSH somewhere safe. Copy the both files generated by the `ssh-keygen`.

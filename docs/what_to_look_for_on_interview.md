# Differences between data analyst, business analyst, data engineer, data scientist

Data science became such a buzzword that every company has one, wants one and most have no idea what it even is and should be. 

There is a very high demand for data analysts, data engineers and data scientists yet most of the positions are far from what the name suggests. 

When looking for a new job in the "data" field, it is very important to first clearly specify what you are looking for. 

Are you a new to data and you would like to start your data career? You should look for a team where your lead is committed to mentorship and willing to spend time developing you. At the start of your career you look for teams where there are multiple data people who you can ask for help and who will be willing to make you code reviews. Without the advice of more experience people it is very difficult and slow to progress.

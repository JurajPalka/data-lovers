# Floating point numbers
Computers use finite precision arithmetic (they obviously canâ€™t store an infinite number of digits!) so remember that every number you see is an approximation. Instead of relying on ==, use near():

```
near(sqrt(2) ^ 2,  2)
#> [1] TRUE
near(1 / 49 * 49, 1)
#> [1] TRUE
```

We are a small community of data analysts, data engineers and data scientists who love working with data and helping each other. 

We like reviewing other people's code as it helps us to learn new things and get better in what we do. 

We embrace any data enthusiasts who face challenges in their data careers and are looking either for help or to help someone else and share their expertise. 

To chat with us, write an email to jurajpalka1@gmail.com and ask to join our community. 

You will then receive an invite to our slack workspace and be one of us :)
